docker-ubuntu
=============

Installs Docker CE or EE according to the [Docker v17.06 Ubuntu guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu/) on:
- Xenial 16.04 (LTS)
- Trusty 14.04 (LTS)

As the Docker ecosystem moves fast the role exclusively supports the two latest Ubuntu LTS versions.

> Please confirm for yourself that the Ansible role still follows the best practices in the Docker installation guide!

Example Plays
-------------

To install Docker CE and manage the host with Ansible:

    - hosts: all
      roles:
         - role: oliverprater.docker-ubuntu

The role provisions `python` and `pip` in accordance with the `ansible_python_interpreter`.

The pip packages `docker` and `docker-compose` ensure that users of this role can use Ansible to build Docker images and manage Docker containers.
This behavior can be configured, but the role supports out of the box:

    - hosts: server
      roles:
         - role: oliverprater.docker-ubuntu
           docker_version: "17.06" # fix docker version for idempotent install behavior
      tasks:
        docker_service:
          project_src: hello_world # assumes a docker-compose file is present
          build: yes

The default behavior on Ubuntu 14.04 is to install AuFS support for Docker.
To override the default configuration as well as use the older `devicemapper` storage engine:

    - hosts: server
      roles:
         - role: oliverprater.docker-ubuntu
           docker_aufs_enabled: no
           docker_config:
             storage-driver: devicemapper

The example above uses the flexible `docker_config` variable to write an `/etc/docker/daemon.json` as described in
[the dockerd reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#linux-configuration-file).
The advantage of the flexibe `docker_config` variable becomes apparrent, when creating a more advanced setup:

    - hosts: server
      vars:
        port_dockerd: 2376
        tls_cacert_dest: "~/.docker/ca.pem"
        tls_cert_dest: "~/.docker/cert.pem"
        tls_key_dest: "~/.docker/key.pem"
      roles:
         - role: oliverprater.docker-ubuntu
           docker_version: "17.06" # fix docker version for idempotent install behavior
           docker_opts: "-H tcp://{{ ansible_default_ipv4['address'] }}:{{ port_dockerd }}"
           docker_config:
             tls: yes
             tlscacert: "{{ tls_cacert_dest }}"
             tlscert: "{{ tls_cert_dest }}"
             tlskey: "{{ tls_key_dest }}"
             tlsverify: yes

This advanced example has docker daemon listen on port 2376 of the host machine via `docker_opts` and configures Docker TLS usage via `docker_config`.
The example makes several assumptions about the host machine setup, which are out of the scope of this roles configuration space.

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below for default values see `defaults/main.yml` as well:

### `docker_apt_cache_valid_time`

Global setting for Ansible's `cache_valid_time`, which determines how long apt cache is valid.

### `docker_aufs_enabled`

Determines whether to install AuFS driver on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

### `docker_apt_key_url` and `docker_apt_key_sig`

The official key information from the Docker guide.

### `docker_apt_release_channel` and `docker_architecture`

Set the release channel and host architecture seperately:

- `docker_apt_release_channel`: **stable** supports 'edge' and 'testing'
- `docker_architecture`: **amd64** supports amd64, armhf, and s390x

### `docker_apt_repository`

Sets the apt repository URL according to the information of `docker_apt_release_channel`, `docker_architecture`, and Ansible's `set_facts` module.
Set to a specific repository URL to override the automatic URL generation.

> Override will ignore `docker_apt_release_channel` and `docker_architecture`

### `docker_edition` and `docker_version`

Set the Docker edition and version seperately:

- `docker_edition`: **ce** supports 'ce' and 'ee'
- `docker_version`: **latest** supports any string e.g. '17.03'

### `docker_package`

Sets the docker package name according to `docker_edition` and `docker_version`, which is sent to the Ansible `apt` module.

> Override will ignore `docker_edition` and `docker_version`

### `docker_config` and `docker_opts`

Please see [the docs for dockerd](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/) for a full list of available options.

- The dict `docker_config` is written to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
- The string `docker_opts` sets the `$DOCKER_OPTS` environment variable.

The options set in the configuration file via `docker_config` must not conflict with options set via flags in `docker_opts`.

> The docker daemon fails to start if an option is duplicated between the file and the flags, regardless their value.

Requirements
------------

Requires python-pycurl for apt modules.
